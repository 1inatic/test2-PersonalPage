## This was my first app with Next.js.   
### I also used TailwindCSS for the first time ever here.

### It contains 
+ ###  a mock "About me" page,  
  
  based on a card design I found on the TailwindCSS documentation.

 + ### a gallery page,  
    
    which I was planning on connecting to a database when I'd have gained the required knoweledge.   
      
      I'd add an "items per page" options. Also each item would load dynamically, accordingly to the database entries.
      
      Another good feature would be to use Next.js **dynamic pages** to create a page for each image, using its [id]. Each page would display the corresponding image and some additional metadata that's stored together in DB like: description, date, etc.
      
  + ### a navigation bar,
 	perhaps I was a bit influeced by the React color palette..
 	
 	
 	
	
  ### Other ideas
- [ ] I was planning on creating a "Donate" button, which would be a way for users of the webpage to donate to me.  
Moreover, I want to make it so that the user donates using a blockchain, specifically 'Algorand'.   
Currently I am just before the knoweledge gathering stage :p, as I am epxloring other JS libraries.
